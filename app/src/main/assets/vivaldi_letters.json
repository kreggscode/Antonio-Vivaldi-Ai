These falsehoods, spread by those who would see my reputation diminished, paint a picture far removed from the truth of our professional relationship.\n\nSignora Gir√≤ is an artist of exceptional talent whom I have had the honor of training and whose career I have fostered through my compositions. Our relationship is one of maestro and student, of composer and interpreter. That she performs my operas with such skill and understanding is testament to her dedication and my instruction, nothing more.\n\nI am a priest of the Holy Church, ordained these thirty-four years, and though my health has long prevented me from celebrating Mass, I have never forsaken my vows or my devotion. The music I create, whether sacred or secular, serves the greater glory of God and the elevation of the human spirit.\n\nThose who whisper scandal know nothing of the demands of artistic creation, of the countless hours spent in rehearsal and revision, of the pure dedication required to bring forth music that moves the soul. They see shadows where there is only light, impropriety where there is only art.\n\nI trust Your Excellency's wisdom and discernment will see through these base accusations. My work speaks for itself, as does my character, known to all who truly know me.\n\nYour most humble and devoted servant,\nAntonio Vivaldi\nMaestro di Violino",

The soprano for whom I write in Venice may possess entirely different strengths than one in Mantua or Rome. Thus, each aria must be crafted not merely as abstract music, but as a vehicle for a particular voice and dramatic moment.\n\nThe orchestra at Sant'Angelo is excellent, though smaller than I might wish. I compensate through careful orchestration, using the strings to maximum effect and employing the winds sparingly but dramatically. Every note must serve both musical and theatrical purposes.\n\nThe libretto, while serviceable, requires constant adjustment. I find myself rewriting arias to better suit the dramatic flow and the capabilities of my singers.
