  "about": "Antonio Vivaldi was an Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher, and Catholic priest. Born in Venice, he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. Vivaldi is known mainly for composing many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as The Four Seasons.",
  
  "earlyLife": "Antonio Lucio Vivaldi was born on March 4, 1678, in Venice, the capital of the Republic of Venice. He was baptized immediately after his birth at his home by the midwife, which led to a belief that his life was somehow in danger. Though not known for certain, the immediate baptism was most likely due to his poor health or to an earthquake that shook the city that day. Vivaldi's father, Giovanni Battista Vivaldi, was a professional violinist who taught Antonio to play the violin and then toured Venice playing the violin with his young son. Antonio was probably taught at an early age, judging by his first known work in 1691, at the age of thirteen. Giovanni Battista was one of the founders of the Sovvegno dei musicisti di Santa Cecilia, an association of musicians. The president of the Sovvegno was Giovanni Legrenzi, a composer of the early Baroque and maestro di cappella at St Mark's Basilica. It is possible that Legrenzi gave the young Antonio his first lessons in composition. Vivaldi's father may have been a composer himself: in 1689, an opera titled La Fedeltà sfortunata was composed by a Giovanni Battista Rossi—'Rossi' is a nickname for people with red hair, which Vivaldi's father was known to have.",
  
  "priesthood": "Vivaldi was ordained a priest in 1703, earning the nickname 'Il Prete Rosso' ('The Red Priest') because of his red hair. Not long after his ordination, in 1704, he was given a dispensation from celebrating Mass because of his ill health. Vivaldi said that he could not say Mass because of 'tightness of the chest', which has been interpreted as a form of asthma. This did not prevent him from traveling extensively throughout Europe. His career as a priest was short-lived, and he soon devoted himself entirely to music. Despite his status as a priest, Vivaldi's personal life was often the subject of gossip, particularly concerning his relationship with his student Anna Girò, a singer who frequently performed in his operas.",
  
  "pietaYears": "In September 1703, Vivaldi became maestro di violino (master of violin) at an orphanage called the Pio Ospedale della Pietà (Devout Hospital of Mercy) in Venice. The Pietà was one of four institutions in Venice that cared for orphaned or abandoned children. While Vivaldi is most famous as a composer, he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well. The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as 'the famous composer and violinist' and said that 'Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion.' Vivaldi remained in the service of the Pietà for most of his career. The Pietà specialized in the musical training of its female wards, and those with musical aptitude were taught to play instruments and sing. Over the years, the Pietà became famous for the quality of its musical performances, which were often attended by the Venetian nobility and foreign visitors. Vivaldi composed most of his major works while working at the Pietà. He wrote hundreds of concertos and sacred vocal music for the all-female ensemble. Many of his compositions were specifically written for the talented musicians at the Pietà, and he tailored his music to showcase their abilities.",
  
  "composerCareer": "Vivaldi's published concerti became relatively unknown, and were largely ignored. Even his most famous work, The Four Seasons, was unknown in its original edition during the classical and romantic periods. In the early 20th century, Fritz Kreisler's Concerto in C, in the Style of Vivaldi (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi's reputation. This spurred the French scholar Marc Pincherle to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, and were acquired by the National Library of Turin. The resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century greatly benefited from the scholarly work of Alfredo Casella, who in 1939 organized the historic Vivaldi Week, in which the rediscovered Gloria (RV 589) and l'Olimpiade were revived. Since World War II, Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed wide success. Historically informed performances, often on 'original instruments', have increased Vivaldi's fame still further. Recent rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi include two psalm settings: Psalm 127, Nisi Dominus RV 803 (in eight movements); and Psalm 110, Dixit Dominus RV 807 (in eleven movements). These were identified in 2003 and 2005, respectively, by the Australian scholar Janice Stockigt.",
  
  "operaticWorks": "Between 1713 and 1719, Vivaldi was responsible for all of the musical activity of the Pietà and wrote several operas, among them Tito Manlio (RV 738) and Teuzzone (RV 736). In 1717 or 1718, Vivaldi was offered a prestigious position as Maestro di Cappella of the court of prince Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt, governor of Mantua. He moved there for three years and produced several operas, among them Tito Manlio (RV 738) and Teuzzone (RV 736). In 1721, he was in Milan, where he presented the pastoral drama La Silvia (RV 734); nine arias from it survive. He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio L'adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Gesù (RV 645, now lost). In 1722 he moved to Rome, where he introduced his operas' new style. The new pope Benedict XIII invited Vivaldi to play for him. In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he was once more put in charge of the Pietà's concerts. He also supplied instrumental music to patrons and customers throughout Europe. Vivaldi wrote more than 40 operas. His style was characterized by a strong rhythmic drive, a clear formal structure, and a brilliant use of orchestral color. His operas were performed throughout Italy and Europe, and he was one of the most famous opera composers of his time.",
  
  "travelAndDecline": "After 1729, Vivaldi stopped publishing his works, possibly due to their declining popularity. In 1730, accompanied by his father, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna and Prague, where his opera Farnace (RV 711) was presented; it garnered six revivals. Some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of Italy's major writers of the time. L'Olimpiade and Catone in Utica were written by Pietro Metastasio, the major representative of the Arcadian movement and court poet in Vienna. La Griselda was rewritten by the young Carlo Goldoni from an earlier libretto by Apostolo Zeno. Like many composers of the time, Vivaldi faced financial difficulties in his later years. The Baroque style of music was falling out of fashion, and the new galant style was becoming popular. Vivaldi's music was seen as old-fashioned, and he struggled to find patrons and audiences for his work. In 1740, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna, hoping to find employment at the court of Emperor Charles VI. However, the emperor died shortly after Vivaldi's arrival, and the composer found himself without a patron in a foreign city. Vivaldi died in Vienna on July 28, 1741, and was given a simple burial. The cost of his funeral was 19 florins and 45 kreuzer, which was about the price of a modest apartment. He was buried in a simple grave at the Hospital Burial Ground in Vienna.",
  
  "musicalStyle": "Vivaldi's music is characterized by its energy, rhythmic vitality, and brilliant orchestration. He was a master of the concerto form, and his works helped to establish the three-movement structure (fast-slow-fast) that became standard for the genre. His concertos often feature virtuosic solo passages that showcase the technical abilities of the performer, particularly in his violin concertos. Vivaldi was also innovative in his use of programmatic elements in music, most famously in The Four Seasons, where he used music to depict scenes from nature and tell stories. His harmonic language was adventurous for his time, and he was not afraid to use dissonance and chromaticism to create dramatic effects. Vivaldi's orchestration was also notable for its clarity and color. He had a gift for writing memorable melodies and creating contrasts between different sections of his works. His music influenced many later composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach, who transcribed several of Vivaldi's concertos for keyboard instruments.",
  
  "legacy": "Vivaldi's music was largely forgotten after his death, and it was not until the 20th century that his works were rediscovered and appreciated. Today, he is recognized as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era, and his music is performed and recorded extensively. The Four Seasons is one of the most popular pieces of classical music ever written, and it has been arranged and adapted countless times for different instruments and ensembles. Vivaldi's concertos have become staples of the classical repertoire, and they are frequently performed by orchestras and soloists around the world. His influence on the development of the concerto form cannot be overstated, and his innovations in orchestration and musical structure paved the way for later composers. Vivaldi's music continues to inspire musicians and audiences today, and his legacy as a composer, violinist, and innovator remains secure. His works are celebrated for their vitality, beauty, and technical brilliance, and they continue to be discovered and appreciated by new generations of music lovers.",
